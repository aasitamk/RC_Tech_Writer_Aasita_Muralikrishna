# Backlog Management
In a product release cycle, each sprint brings the opportunity of working in a specific stage of content creation, with the help of the different areas involved. It may be interesting to create distinct content backlogs of information aimed for either end users or technical readers.

### Sprint 1 - Content Planning
When organizing the process of creating the technical documentation of a feature, its content management tasks should be performed right from the feature definition and prototyping phase.
That is when the technical writer gets a taste of what is coming, with some high level information of the development tasks (backend and frontend) as well as a general picture of the new functionality, which may be usefull when generating the user and product documentation.
During this phase, the tech writer should also study the existing documentation in search of related topics which may still be ongoing or published. Afterall, reusing material, linking topics and grouping similar contents are some of the ways to having a concise documentation.

### Sprints 2 and 3 - Content Creation
At the beginning of the development phase, a draft introduction to the feature can be outlined, like a _"What's New?"_ page, containing a brief overview of the functionality and some key positive points to enrich the product and user documentations.
Along with the work of the development teams, it would also be the time to collect technical detailed information which will be specially useful when putting the software documentation together. For that, a close and constant communication with the development team is essencial. The use of a scrum tool would offer the opportunity for everyone involved in the project to align the evolution of their tasks in real time.
Sprint 3 is when the documentation should be mostly ready and revised by the teams (or at least peer-reviewed).

### Sprint 4 - Content Publishing
The whole content produced must now be distributed into the different documentation versions: product, end user or technical. Also, the paid special features should be available only for the paid version of the documentation. To avoid having repeated information in the different versions of the documentation, using licences or conditioning are an option for having a unique content, managed to be displayed in whichever set of documentation is applicable.
After a thorough review of the content produced, the final structure must look clear and compact, ready for its validation for the release shipment.
